what i learned from brave new world: nothing.
While Abdullah "The Warrior King" al-Hussein II (I'm not kidding, a news site actually called him that) isn't personally going out and bombing ISIS strongholds, that doesn't lessen the importance of Jordan joining the fight. A alarming number of people have asked me "well why don't more middle eastern countries go fight ISIS if they're so unrepresentative of islam?" Well here you go, no need to point to occasional UAE/Qatari airstrikes, Jordan is going all out and now amassing troops on the Iraqi border.
Also as I always say, good to see another country actually taking action insofar as international security goes without having the USA drag them in kicking and screaming.
